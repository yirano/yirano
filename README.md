### *Heyo*! My name is **Tiffany**. :wave:
<br />

### I'm a frontend focused Fullstack developer who obsessively builds projects with... <br />
:fire: **React** <br />
:fire: **Redux** <br />
:fire: **NodeJS** <br />
:fire: **Express** <br />
<br />

#### I have a knack for `efficiency` and `debugging` broken code. I really live for those `Aha!` moments that comes from obsessing over the two.


#### I'm currently working on updating my portfolio, but here are some projects that you can take a look at in the meantime!


Let's start you off with some of my *favorite*  projects I completed as a student at Lambda School.
